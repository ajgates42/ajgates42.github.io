Furthermore, distinctly from government grants, philanthropic funders tend to focus locally, suggesting that other criteria, beyond research excellence, play an important role in their funding decisions.

Here we leverage a massive longitudinal dataset, capturing the exhibition and auction sales of 56,678 gender-identified artists in 20,115 institutions. We confirm gender differences in population and access to exhibitions, with nearly 1.75 men for every women artist, an effect that increases for more prestigious institutions. Using this global population gender imbalance as a new baseline, we develop a measure of institutional bias that, combined with the network of artist trajectories, reveals systematic echo-chambers which limit the access for some artists to future exhibition opportunities. Finally, we demonstrate that the gender bias of institutions induces a strong gender difference in the access to the secondary auction market, with the most prestigious institutions enabling twice the access for male artists than for female artists. Taken together, this quantitative perspective of gender equality in art suggests that to establish gender equality in art, it is not enough to just increase the participation of women artists, we must break down these so called ``glass fences'' which systematically limit artist access based on gender.","tags":["SystemicInequality","GenderInequality"],"title":"Quantifying systemic gender inequality in art","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander J.

The situtation is even worse for generalized definitions of clusterings that include overlaps or hierarchy.\nHere I show that existing clustering similarity measures are very poor at measuring differences in heterogeneously sized clusters commonly found in social applications, and no measure was available for overlapping and hierarchically structured clusterings.\nTo solve these problems, I first modified two popular clustering similarity measures (ARI and NMI) by expanding the definition of random clusters from the permutation model (which fixes the sizes and numbers of clusters) to more realistic random set-theoretic models (which allow for cluster sizes and numbers to vary). These modifications revealed that certain clustering methods would appear to perform well in the context of permutation models, yet, in the context of realistic random-set models, performed worse than randomly generated solutions.\nSecond, I proposed a new way of thinking about clustering similarity in terms of the connectedness of the data elements (rather than the overlap of clusters). This new element-centric clustering similarity measure naturally accommodates overlapping and hierarchical clusterings. Using the element-wise contributions to this new method, I can trace how community structures change across different regions of the network; for example, in a Facebook social network (Figure above), the dormitory is well aligned to network structure for freshman and sophomores, but fails to reflect friendships amongst juniors and seniors.\nRead More: The impact of random models on clustering similarity Alexander J.

However, even simple automata components can lead to collective dynamics that are computationally intractable when aggregated into networks. In previous work we demonstrated that automata network models of biochemical regulation are highly canalizing, whereby many variable states and their groupings are redundant (Marques-Pita and Rocha, 2013). The precise charting and measurement of such canalization simplifies these models, making even very large networks amenable to analysis. Moreover, canalization plays an important role in the control, robustness, modularity and criticality of Boolean network dynamics, especially those used to model biochemical regulation (Gates and Rocha, 2016; Gates et al., 2016; Manicka, 2017). Here we describe a new publicly-available Python package that provides the necessary tools to extract, measure, and visualize canalizing redundancy present in Boolean network models. It extracts the pathways most effective in controlling dynamics in these models, including their effective graph and dynamics canalizing map, as well as other tools to uncover minimum sets of control variables.","tags":["BooleanNetworks"],"title":"CANA: A python package for quantifying control and canalization in Boolean Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander J.

A pivotal aspect of clustering analysis is quantitatively comparing clusterings; clustering comparison is the basis for many tasks such as clustering evaluation, consensus clustering, and tracking the temporal evolution of clusters. In particular, the extrinsic evaluation of clustering methods requires comparing the uncovered clusterings to planted clusterings or known metadata. Yet, as we demonstrate, existing clustering comparison measures have critical biases which undermine their usefulness, and no measure accommodates both overlapping and hierarchical clusterings. Here we unify the comparison of disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchically structured clusterings by proposing a new element-centric framework: elements are compared based on the relationships induced by the cluster structure, as opposed to the traditional cluster-centric philosophy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to standard clustering similarity measures, our framework does not suffer from critical biases and naturally provides unique insights into how the clusterings differ. We illustrate the strengths of our framework by revealing new insights into the organization of clusters in two applications: the improved classification of schizophrenia based on the overlapping and hierarchical community structure of fMRI brain networks, and the disentanglement of various social homophily factors in Facebook social networks. The universality of clustering suggests far-reaching impact of our framework throughout all areas of science.","tags":["Clustering"],"title":"Element-centric clustering comparison unifies overlaps and hierarchy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander J.

CANA can also be used to calculate all measures of canalization that derive from removing dynamical redundancy via two-symbol schemata re-description (Marques-Pita and Rocha, 2013): effective connectivity, input redundancy, and input symmetry. At the network level, CANA also calculates the effective graph, a weighted and directed graph whose edge weights denote their effective contribution to node transitions. Finally, CANA can compute several measures of controllability that depend on the Controlled State Transition Graph.\nRead More: The effective graph reveals redundancy, canalization, and control pathways in biochemical regulation and signaling Alexander J.

As such individuals interact with an environment, they undergo sequences of structural changes that correspond to their ontogenies. Ultimately, individuals that adapt to their environment, and increase their chances of survival, persist. This article provides an initial step towards a more formal treatment of these concepts. A network of possible ontogenies is uncovered by subjecting a model protocell to sequential perturbations and mapping the resulting structural configurations. The analysis of this network reveals trends in how the protocell can move between configurations, how its morphology changes, and how the role of the environment varies throughout. Viability is defined as expected life span given an initial configuration. This leads to two notions of adaptivity: a local adaptivity that addresses how viability changes in plastic transitions, and a global adaptivity that looks at longer-term tendencies for increased viability. To demonstrate how different protocell-environment pairings produce different patterns of ontogenic change, we generate and analyze a second ontogenic network for the same protocell in a different environment. Finally, the mechanisms of a minimal adaptive transition are analyzed, and it is shown that these rely on distributed spatial processes rather than an explicit regulatory mechanism. The combination of this model and analytical techniques provides a foundation for studying the emergence of viability, ontogeny, and adaptivity in more biologically realistic systems.","tags":["Autopoiesis"],"title":"The Structure of Ontogenies in a Model Protocell","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eran Agmon","Alexander J.

Combining robustness and plasticity provides a measure of viability as the average expected survival time under ongoing perturbation, and allows us to measure how viability is affected as the configuration undergoes transitions.

We find partitions of system variables that maximize “perturbation modularity,” defined as the autocovariance of coarse-grained perturbed trajectories. The measure effectively separates the fast intramodular from the slow intermodular dynamics of perturbation spreading (in this respect, it is a generalization of the “Markov stability” method of network community detection). Our approach captures variation of modular organization across different system states, time scales, and in response to different kinds of perturbations: aspects of modularity which are all relevant to real-world dynamical systems. It offers a principled alternative to detecting communities in networks of statistical dependencies between system variables (e.g., “relevance networks” or “functional networks”). Using coupled logistic maps, we demonstrate that the method uncovers hierarchical modular organization planted in a system's coupling matrix. Additionally, in homogeneously coupled map lattices, it identifies the presence of self-organized modularity that depends on the initial state, dynamical parameters, and type of perturbations. Our approach offers a powerful tool for exploring the modular organization of complex dynamical systems.","tags":["ComplexSystems"],"title":"Modularity and the spread of perturbations in complex dynamical systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shamik Das","Alexander J.

This paper demonstrates via simulation that the nanodevices and nanofabrication techniques developed recently for general-purpose nanocomputers also might be applied with substantial benefit to implement less complex nanocircuits targeted at specific applications. Nanocircuits considered here are a digital controller for the leg motion on an autonomous millimeter-scale robot and an analog nanocircuit for amplification of signals in a tiny optoelectronic sensor or receiver. Simulations of both nanocircuit designs show significant improvement over microelectronic designs in metrics such as footprint area and power consumption. These improvements are obtained from designs employing nanodevices and nanofabrication techniques that already have been demonstrated experimentally.
